            <p>Overall, CS 347 has been an enjoyable and useful course. I feel as though I have learned many new skills and concepts that I will hopefully be able to use in my future career. Below, I have listed some of the Pros, Cons, and Suggestions for the couse in my opinion.</p>

            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lecture Videos
                    <ul>
                        <li>The lecture videos were very helpful and a great resource for learning. Being able to watch them at my own speed, pausing and rewinding when neccessary, and re-watch them throughout the course to review particular concepts was useful and helped me to get a good grasp on the material.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In-class Labs
                    <ul>
                        <li>Labs gave students the opprtunity to implement important concepts from the past lecture video, which was valuable learning experience. The labs were an appropriate amount of challenging, where success was attainable, but students needed to have watched the videos to succeed. Working with other students helped to build a community amoung classmates and allowed peer-to-peer teaching and cooperation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Projects
                    <ul>
                        <li>Projects in computer science courses are always one of the most valuable aspects of the course, as they test the student's understanding of and ability to implement important concepts and skills. The two projects in this course have been useful learning experiences and have tied together some of the biggest and most importatnt learning outcomes of the course.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Lecture Videos
                    <ul>
                        <li>One negative about the lecture videos is that students are not able to interact with the professor and ask questions while learning material. However, in my opinion this was okay, as most of the videos were very clear and students were given the opportunity to ask questions at the beginning of each class. Furthermore, using Slack as a means for out-of-class interaction gave students a means to ask their questions and receive responses in a timely manner.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In-class Labs
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the labs were overall a positive aspect of the course, the experience of each group was highly dependent on the set of students. Some groups were highly successful, while other groups faced challenges with equal distribution of work and teamwork. The success rate of a group highly correlated with the number of group members who watched the video and had a reasonably understanding of the material. As a student who had watched the videos, it is frustrating to be in a group with students who had not or who are uncooperative.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Suggestions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Assignment Schedule
                    <ul>
                        <li>At times, I felt like it was difficult to keepp track of what was due when and what assignments we had in this course. A page on the course website dedicated to tracking assignments and their due dates would be a very useful addition to the course for future semesters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Slack
                    <ul>
                        <li>While Slack was useful for asking questions and interacting with classmates, I do not think it is a good platform to post important announcements. Announcements via Slack were hard to keep track of and I did not always see them right away. I would suggest posting announcements on the course website, to keep important course information in one place and make information easier to find.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
