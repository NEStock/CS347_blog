            <p>The focus of Lecture 10 was responsive web design. Responsive web design <q class="quote">responds to the needs of the users and the devices they're using</q> <a id="reference" href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">-Ethan Marotte.</a> The layout of a website should be adaptable to a varying set of environments, which are definted by the user accessing the information and the technology displaying the information.</p>

            <p>In our video lectures this week, we focused on how to make a website responsive to the technology it is being accessed on and its capabilities. The main distinctions we see in technologies are screen size and input type. A website must adapt its display based on the screen size and orientation. Additionally, a website must consider devices which are controlled by a mouse and keyboard vs. devices controlled by touch screens.</p>

            <p>Some of the tips and tricks for responsive web design I found are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Break content up into sections. Then organize these sections based on device <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/responsive-design-best-practices">[1]</a></li>
                <li>Make your call-to-action the center of attention and easy to find on all devices <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/responsive-design-best-practices">[1]</a></li>
                <li>Standardize clickable areas and buttons <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/responsive-design-best-practices">[1]</a></li>
                <li>Use Media Queries to differentiate style based on conditionals <a href="https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/#media-queries">[2]</a></li>
                <li>Set the viewport <a href="https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/#media-queries">[2]</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Below are a set of links to other pages on my blog:</p>
            <ul id="buttons">
                <li><a href="blog1.html" class="button">blog 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="blog2.html" class="button">blog 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="blog3.html" class="button">blog 3</a></li>
                <li><a href="index.html" class="button">home</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>A user accessing this site on a desktop with a mouse as their cursor should have a relatively easy time clicking the intended link. However, a user accessing this site on a mobile device would have a much more difficult time selecting the intended link. As website designers, we must keep in mind that the precision of a mouse versus a typical finger is very different. In order to make the links more accessible on a mobile device, I will add a border and background color and increase the padding and margins.</p>

            <p>Below are the mobile device friendly links:</p>
            <div id="buttons-mobile">
                <div><a href="blog1.html" class="button-mobile">blog 1</a></div>
                <div><a href="blog2.html" class="button-mobile">blog 2</a></div>
                <div><a href="blog3.html" class="button-mobile">blog 3</a></div>
                <div><a href="index.html" class="button-mobile">home</a></div>
            </div>

            <p>I achieved these buttons using the following CSS</p>

<pre>#buttons-mobile {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    border: none;
    margin: 20px;
}

.button-mobile {
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 20px;
    border: black 1px solid;
    border-radius: 5px;
    width: fit-content;
    background-color: rgb(145, 183, 255);
    display: block;
}

.button-mobile:active {
    background-color: lightcoral;
}</pre>
            
        </main>
        
        <footer>
            <a href="index.html">Return to Home Page</a>
        </footer>
    </div>

</body>
