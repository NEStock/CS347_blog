            <p>The past few weeks of CS 347 have involved a lot a new content. We have learned new technologies such as React, Express, Web Services, Databases, and Redux. Our most recent lecture was an introduction to Redux. The three main pieces of Redux are the global store, actions, and reducers. We experimented with all three in our lecture to get a basic understand of Redux and how the pieces work together.</p>

            <p>To get myself more familiar with Redux, I did some research outside of class. While reading about Redux can be helpful, I find that I learn best while actually implementing what I am learning. Thus, I decided to recreate the app described <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-redux-hooks-useselector-and-usedispatch-f7d8c7f75cdd" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

            <p>One thing about this exmaple that I like is the modularity of the acitons and reducers. All of the actions and all of the reducers are stored in directories actions and reducers, respectively. Additionally, there is an index.js file in each directory which imports all of the actions or reducers from the other files in the directory, then exports them all for use. The result of this is that index.js (in the src directory) and App.js only needs one import for all actions and one for all reducers, regardless of the number of files they are contained in.</p>

            <p>In addition to re-creating the app, I added a text input field that allows a user to set their own name, rather than having a single default username as in the app. I accomplished this with the following code additions to App.js.</p>

<pre>
const [username,setUsername] = useState("");

const setName = name => {
    setUsername(username => name);
}
</pre>

<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Login&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username" onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;button onClick={() => dispatch(allActions.userActions.setUser({name: username}))}>Login&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

            <p>Below is a demonstration of my app.</p>
