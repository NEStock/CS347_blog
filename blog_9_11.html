            <p>Welcome to my first blog!</p>
            <p>This week, we learned about the Monocolumn UI Pattern and Cards. I used the Monocolumn UI Pattern to create this website. In this pattern, all of the page content is in the center column, which has a fixed width. One of the advantages of this pattern is that users can view the page at a smaller width than full screen and not miss any content. However, if their screen is too thin, they will still need to scroll horizontally to see the entire content. I am not sure how to fix this at the moment, but I believe we will learn more about page formatting and accessibility throughout the course.</p>
            <p>Another interesting concept we have learned about is web accessibility for users who are different from ourselves. Before this lesson, I had thought about accessibility for users viewing a website on different browsers and devices, but I had not considered users who may interact with websites in very different ways, such as using a screen reader instead of actually viewing the page. It was very interesting to me to learn about how to make a website accessible to those who cannot actually see the website. Some of the tips we learned are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML elements should describe the meaning or form of their content</li>
                <li>Provide alt teext for all visuals</li>
                <li>HTML elements are not intended for visual use</li>
            </ul>
